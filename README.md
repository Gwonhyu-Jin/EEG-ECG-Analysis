# EEG-ECG Analysis Program Instruction

## System requirements

MATLAB & Signal Processing Toolboxâ„¢

## Prepare data analysis

This program only deals with \*.mat files.
Before run program to analysis your data, you should check labeling of your data correspond to program's channel information. Additionally, you should be aware of indexing of MATLAB is starting from 1 (not 0).

## Run programs

1. Using MATLAB interpreter, run `analysis.m` file.
2. Enter number of data file to analysis.
3. Enter each data file of name (relative path / absolute path) and starting time of video stimulation in data.
4. Check R-wave detection is done properly using pop-up graph. If analysis is not done properly, you can modify parameters for analysis. (See troubleshooting part)
5. Analysis result will be saved in `./Result.xlsx` files while displaying analysis result.
6. Check data analysis result considering order of sheet, column, and row.

  + Row order: Order of data that you made input
+ Sheet 2: Standard deviation of heart rate  
  + Column order: Scenes (Default: Fixation cross - Neutral scene - Scene 1 - Scene 2 - Scene 3 - Black screen 1 - Black screen 2 - Black screen 3 - Black screen 4)
  + Row order: Order of data that you made input

## Troubleshooting

If you have a problem for ECG analysis, you should modify parameter manually checking detrended data graph.
+ Order of equation
  + Decide order or equation for detrending. We use method of least squares to calculate trend of data. If data is too turbulent, you can detrend data using higher order of equation.
+ MinPeakHeight
  + Decide minimum value to ignore low-value peak. We use multiplication value between entered rate and maximum value of detrended ECG data as MinPeakHeight.
+ MinPeakDistance
  + Decide minimum distance to ignore peak near to R-wave.  

If you use different video as stimulus or want to analysis in other frequency, you can modify variables for setting in `analysis.m` and `calc_mean_square_error.m`, following comments instruction at the top of the code.
